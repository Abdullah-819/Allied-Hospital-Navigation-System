Hospital Navigation System (CLI Version)
Description

The Hospital Navigation System is a C++ console-based application designed to provide a text-based, GUI-like experience for navigating a hospital. The system simulates a hospital layout with rooms and allows users to find the shortest path between rooms using graph-based algorithms (BFS/Dijkstra).

The project emphasizes clean code structure, modularity, and the application of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in a practical scenario.

This CLI version uses:

ASCII maps and panels for visual representation

Colored text for highlighting rooms and information

Menus and structured layout to mimic a GUI experience

Features

Structured CLI interface with header, menu, info panel, and map

Interactive room selection using keyboard input

Shortest path calculation between rooms using graph algorithms

Colorful text and borders for a clean, attractive display

Fully modular C++ design: separate files for hospital, navigation, and main loop
